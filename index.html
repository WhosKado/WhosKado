<h1>THE SHIT IM TYPING UP AT THE MOMENT</h1>
<body>
<h5>Everything I am about to learn will be noted here...</h5>
<div class="grid-container">
<div><h2>HTML</h2>
<p>I use this all the time and I am becoming proficient.</p></div>
<div><h2>CSS</h2>
<p>I know some CSS but I am learning a fuck ton more just trying to build the sites to my vision. I am definitely surprised I never utilized CSS grid...I  know flexbox and all that but I wonder if you can code flex containers into specific parts of the grid. Seems plausible.</p></div>
<div><h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
<p>I need to build the functionality of 2 sites 1st S. Josiah Music and then wavpax.co for sjosiah music, I need player w/download-sub capture (email auto responder api) gallery, quick bio linked out to full</p></div>
<div><h2>PYTHON</h2>
<p>Next up after Javascript and Typescript</p></div>
<div><h2>RUST</h2>
<p>Not gonna be a bad idea to learn this language considering it to my understanding is pretty much c and c++</p></div>
<div><h2>PHP</h2>
<p>can be embeded straight into html...if I understand that correctly it could be a very useful way to add functionality.</p></div>
<div><h2>SOLIDITY</h2>
<p>Gotta learn them smart contracts. Web 3 intergration seems to be mostly financial at this point. I am keeping my ear to the ground we have to keep this thinig decentralized at least inn some area where we can create a safe haven.</p></div>
<div><h2>GIT/TERMINAL</h2>
<p>Gotta learn this because it just makes me so damn happy and excited like I am about hack the matrix cosmic simulation...lol</p></div>
